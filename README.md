This repository was forked from lresisi/TextDisrupt - which is an andriod app I made with few more guys for ReutHackathon beween 4-5 of May 2017. 

This application was made in order to help dyslexic people cope with their condition by offering several text manipulations features such as:
  a. Text emphasis
  b. Text speech
  c. focus on individual words
  d. change fonts
  e. change text size
  f. space lines
  and more...
